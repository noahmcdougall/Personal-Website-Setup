		p Even though I was a tour guide at Tuckaleechee Caverns for five years, I never started caving until I moved away from #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAG_Corner" style="text-decoration:underline") TAG] to go to school in Arizona.  Another graduate student offered to bring other people along while she did some of her research.  I had geeked out on caves for so long, I had to jump on the opportunity.  The cave was beautiful and full of gypsum, but the whole time I spent focused on the sharp pain in my knees for having forgot knee pads.  I loved the experience, but it did not leave me wanting to pursue a second venture.

		p Six months after moving to Houston, I hadn't made too many friends outside of work.  One of my coworkers, a long-time Austin caver, suggested we try out the Greater Houston Grotto (GHG) together. We both agreed to show up at the monthly meeting together.  I remember walking into the room full of people, but no sight of my coworker!   Nervously, I mustered up the courage to awkwardly talk to two new people.  One used to be a tour guide in a cave, just like me.  The other later became a hit of a #[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAY-t32vyds&t=6m18s" style="text-decoration:underline") viral video]. Two hours later, the meeting was over. I was heading for the door when my coworker walked in wearing a big, Texas-sized cowboy hat.  His only words were, "Am I late?"

		p The beginner GHG caving trip featured a small opening underneath an overpass in Austin.  You had to climb down a ladder and crawl for what seemed like miles.  I left that cave more sore than I had the one in Arizona.  I even remembered knee pads this time!  At this point, I kind of felt like caving was not for me, but I thought I'd stick around for the cool people I had met.  They eventually convinced me to try out some other caves, and I've ended up loving every cave since then.  I've had some of my most memorable moments with the GHG.  There isn't a group full of more unique, interesting, and fun people.  Eventually, a job opportunity opened up in Nashville.  Now, the anxiety of joining a new group starts all over again!
